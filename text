I have added some [example FASTQ files](https://github.com/camilagazolla/Trial-By-Fire/tree/main/example_data) here for reproducibility. 😀

## Creating plots to inspect read quality profiles

Can consume 🐡

- [FASTQ files](https://github.com/camilagazolla/Trial-By-Fire/tree/main/example_data)

Can provide 🍣

- [Table](https://github.com/camilagazolla/x) with taxonomic assignments from order to genus

**On R:**

``` 
# path to folder containing the reads (decompressed FASTQ)
path <- "C:/Users/pedro/Desktop/Trial_by_fire/example_data"

############## END PARAMETER SELECTION 

library(dada2)

setwd(path)

# create "quality" folder on path
dir.create("quality") 

# file parsing
fns <- sort(list.files(pattern=".fastq"))

# plot quality profile for each FASTQ
for (i in unique(fns)){
  png(paste0(path, "/quality/", gsub(".fastq","", i), "_quality.png"))
  print(plotQualityProfile(i))
  dev.off()
}

```
